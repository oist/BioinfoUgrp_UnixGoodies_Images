OIST's bioinformatics user group Unix goodies images
====================================================

GitHub actions workflow to create Debian images containing nice Unix tools for
OISTs bioinformatics user group.

See also <https://github.com/oist/BioinfoUgrp> and
<https://salsa.debian.org/plessy/debalamod>.

## How to use the image on OISTs HPC cluster

 - Activate the modules with `ml bioinfo-ugrp-modules UnixGoodies`.
 - Discover them with `ml av`.
 - Load them with `ml`, followed by the module's name.  

## How to get the image:

If you are not at OIST or if you need the image elsewhere, you can download
it from GitHub with Singularity.  If Singularity is available as a module you
may need to run `ml singularity` before pulling the image.  Then, pull it with
`singularity pull docker://ghcr.io/oist/bioinfougrp_unixgoodies_images:latest`.

with write permissions for packages.

```
podman login ghcr.io
podman pull  ghcr.io/oist/bioinfougrp_unixgoodies_images:latest
podman tag   ghcr.io/oist/bioinfougrp_unixgoodies_images:latest ghcr.io/oist/bioinfougrp_unixgoodies_images:13.0-1

## For admins, how to create the modules

This is likely to change in the future.

```
ml singularity

ln -s bioinfougrp_unixgoodies_images_13.0-1.sif ./debalamod.sif
./debalamod.sif cp /debalamod .
for pkg in $(./debalamod.sif cat /debalamod_pkg_list); do ./debalamod $pkg; done
